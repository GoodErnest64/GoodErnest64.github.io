## Number Guessing Game In (Almost) Every Programming Language

So I've been known for knowing a little bit of al ot of langyages and I tried to test myself !
I tried to make the number guessing game in every language I knew !

### How Does The Game Work ?
The game consists of a Random Number Generator (RNG) and use input where a random integer 
between 0 to 100 is chosen by the machine and the user has to guess the number and the machine 
responds to the user and tells him if the inut was higher or lower than the random number.
the machine is gonna count the user's tries and at the end it is gonna be anounced to the user.
